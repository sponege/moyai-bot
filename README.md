# Moyai Bot
Jordan's Discord bot template

# Installation
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for your OS of choice

Install [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download/) for your OS of choice (I would highly recommend MariaDB for simplicity)

Also install [Discord Chat Exporter CLI](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter)

# Commands
```
npm i
npm i -g forever
forever start bot.js
```

Connect to your database and run the commands in [dbsetup.sql](./dbsetup.sql) and you're all set!

You can set up the prefix and see the commands in the [config.json](./config.json) file :)
